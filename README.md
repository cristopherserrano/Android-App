### Milestone:
For the milestone, we created a starting screen that has an incomplete sign in feature and a new user button.
We have not built the database we will use for the application yet, so right now we are not saving any of the information the user inputs.
The new user button begins the process to create an account and set your preferences.  The user goes to different activities to input their information, allergies, and diet, and then is sent to the main application with a bottom navigation system.  Currently the only tab we have with information in it is the 'Meal Plan'.  The floating action button in the bottom right of this activity is not connected, but it will open a new activity where the user selects their meals for the week.  The meals are displayed in a GridView, and when a meal is clicked it opens up a new activity with an enlarged image of the meal and a title.  In the future, this is where the recipe/ingredients for the meal will be.
